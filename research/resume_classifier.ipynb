University  Mentor Dr Anoop Sarkar  During the course of the internship I developed a C wrapper for implementing the Factored Language Model functions present in the SRILM language  modeling  toolkit  The  internship  also  involved  designing  and  implementing  Factored  Language  Models  containing  morphologybased feature functions for languages having complex morphology and check the variations in translation quality May 2010 – July 2010 Vancouver Canada SUMMER INTERNSHIP Microsoft Research India  Mentor Dr Monojit Choudhury  My  main  internship  project  was  based  on  the  Dorogovtsev  and  Mendes  model  which  explains  the  degree  distribution  of  word  cooccurrence networks  We  explored  the  fact  that  although  this  model  can  explain  the  degree  distribution  it  is  not  sufficient  to  explain  some  of  the  global topological properties of the networks We conducted spectral analysis on networks to demonstrate this May 2010 – July 2010 Bangalore India M Tech Thesis Correction of noisy sentences using a monolingual corpus Guide Dr Sudeshna Sarkar July 2010 – present My work is based on autocorrecting noisy sentences using a corpus of the same language Initially I am modeling this as a decoding problem and selecting the nbest outputs based on the language model score This work is still in its infancy and no substantial output has yet been obtained If this approach fails I plan to use Textual Entailment approaches to solve this problem July 2010 – present Design Lab Project A framework for cognitive experiments Guide Dr Anupam Basu This project is based on a number of cognitive tests along the likes present in the CANTAB test platform of Cambridge university The aim of this work is to develop a framework using which we shall be able to administer a number of cognitive tests I have developed the feature set in order to parameterize the different tests and currently working on developing the GUIs for the tests The language being used is Python and for developing the GUIs I am using wxPython July 2010 – present B Tech Thesis Bilingual Dictionary Extraction from Comparable Corpora Guide Dr Sudeshna Sarkar In this work we considered an Eigenvector based approach and a word cooccurrence based approach in order to derive bilingual dictionaries from EnglishHindi nonparallel corpora We considered only singleword terms in this work July 2009April 2010 Term Project Comparing the Properties of Query Logs and Natural Language Guide Dr Niloy Ganguly In this project we modeled query logs and natural language as a set of word cooccurrence graphs and compared the properties of the networks Based on the properties of the networks we derived a parallelism between query logs and natural language sentences The codes  were written in Python and C and used the Networkx library in Python to compute the network properties Feb 2010April 2010 MultiDocument opinion summarization Guide Dr Sudeshna Sarkar In this project we have considered a statistical approach to document summarization  We have used the lexrank method of sentence ranking but we have used a different metricformula for ranking We have not concentrated
